1.41_07 2014-03-13
    - Updated to SQLite 3.8.4.1, which fixed several obscure bugs on
      "ORDER BY" or "DISTINCT". (ISHIGAKI)

1.41_06 2014-02-12
    - Updated to SQLite 3.8.3.1, which fixed a SQLite bug in 3.8.2
      (bundled in DBD::SQLite 1.41_04/5) that could cause queries to
      omit valid out rows. (ISHIGAKI)

1.41_05 2014-01-22
    - Resolved #92322: Failure under heavily parallelized tests
      (ISHIGAKI)

    - Resolved #89351: DBD-SQLite won't compile on Cygwin 64 bit
      (Warren Young++) (ISHIGAKI)
    - Tweaked sqlite_see_if_its_a_number not to guess data types of
      bind values with explicit type specification (via bind_param()
      etc) (mje++, ilmari++) (ISHIGAKI)

1.41_03 2013-09-05

      (ISHIGAKI)

1.41_01 2013-08-27
    *** NOTICE ON NEXT GENERATION QUERY PLANNER ***
    - As of SQLite 3.8.0, SQLite's query planner has been rewritten.
      According to the author, the new query planner should give
      exactly the same result (though perhaps with a little less CPU
      time spent planning) for simple queries, and for complex
      queries, it can in many cases provide a much faster answer.
      See http://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner-ng.html for details.

    *** NOTICE ON PARTIAL INDICES ***
    - Database files created by SQLite 3.8.0 are still readable and
      writable by prior versions, but if you use partial indices
      introduced in SQLite 3.8.0, those files become unreadable and
      unwritable by older versions of (DBD::)SQLite. They'll be
      readable/writable again by dropping partial indices.

    - Resolved #87435: PATCH: statistics_info perldoc (DDICK)
    - Resolved #87297: URI filenames in DBD::SQLite (ISHIGAKI)

    - Disabled a unicode-related test for older perls (ISHIGAKI)

1.38_04 2013-05-29
    - Tentatively defined _XOPEN_SOURCE under *BSD systems to see
      if it solves a compilation issue for threaded perls (ISHIGAKI)

1.38_03 2013-05-20
    *** NOTICE ON QUERY OPTIMIZER ENHANCEMENT ***
    - As of SQLite 3.7.15, SQLite's query optimizer was enhanced
      and the result order of a SELECT statement without an ORDER
      BY clause may be different from the one of the previous
      versions. If your applications or tests mistakenly depend
      on the arbitrary output order, they may be broken with this
      enhancement.

    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.17 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Fixed tests that mistakenly made invalid assumptions about
      the result order (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added a brief note on useful pragmata. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #85302: type fixes (ISHIGAKI)

1.38_02 2013-04-04
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.16.1 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Removed two obsolete pragma calls at login time (ISHIGAKI)

      DISTINCT (RURBAN/ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #70815: DBD::SQLite 1.33 build is broken under
      Solaris using Sun C (RURBAN)
    - Resolved #84380: Fix WINLIKE for mingw/msys (RURBAN)
    - Added a note on DBD::SQLite and File::Temp (suggested by
      TOKUHIROM) (ISHIGAKI)

1.38_01 2012-09-24
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Resolved #56444: immediate transaction should be on by
      default, and the doc be updated.
      If you really need the deferred transaction (which had long
      been the default), set sqlite_use_immediate_transaction
      to false explicitly. (ISHIGAKI)

    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.14 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added support for foreign_key_info (DAMI/ISHIGAKI)
    - Added several methods to retrieve internal information such as
      table_column_metadata/db_filename/*_status (ISHIGAKI/VOVKASM)
    - Added sqlite_load_extension so that extensions can add
      functions internally (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #77617: atoll () sometimes just is atol () (GAAS)
    - Resolved #48084: improper "require utf8" in tests (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #77724: bug in primary_key_info with regard to column
      names containing whitespace (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #79364: variance example of the doc (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #78833: utf8 flag for column names (JAMADAM)
      (This hopefully resolved #72418 as well)
    - Resolved #64177: ping() wipes out the errstr (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #79576: (patch) bind_param don't work with PADTMP
      scalars (VOVKASM)
    - Refactored primary_key_info to support attached databases
      (ISHIGAKI)

1.37 2012-06-12
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.12.1 (ISHIGAKI)

1.36_04 2012-05-19
    - Final developer release
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.12 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Tweaked Makefile.PL to behave better during the Bsymbolic
      check (HMBRAND)
    - Added SQLITE_WITHOUT_ZONEMALLOC for older MacOS X (ISHIGAKI)

1.36_03 2012-05-07
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.11 (ISHIGAKI)

      condition issue (Yuriy Kaminskiy)
    - Fix integer overflow in passing argument to perl function
      (Yuriy Kaminskiy)
    - Convert unsigned -> int64 when possible (Yuriy Kaminskiy)
    - Turned datatype mismatch error (introduced in 1.34_02) into
      a warning (you can disable this warning by setting PrintWarn
      attribute to false). (ISHIGAKI)
    - Refactored sqlite_is_number to fix various corner cases
      (ISHIGAKI)

1.36_02 2012-02-23
    - Downgraded SQLite to 3.7.9, as 3.7.10 turned out to be
      broken on the latest MacOS X (due to a missing symbol),
      and broke other modules that typically use temporary tables
      under a few environments too. As of this writing, would-be
      3.7.11 seems fine, but it would take another month to be
      released. (ISHIGAKI)

1.36_01 2012-01-19
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.10 (ISHIGAKI)
      Note that this release changed the default schema format
      number, that means newly created database files will be
      unreadable by SQLite version prior to 3.3.0 (2006-01-10)
      (or DBD::SQLite prior to 1.12) unless you explicitly issue
      "PRAGMA legacy_file_format=ON".

    - Enabled SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS4
    - Enabled SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3
    - Resolved #73159: FTS tokenizer segfault (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #73787: sqlite_see_if_its_a_number causes a buffer
      overflow (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #73314 for DBD-SQLite: binding of 64bit integers fail
      on 1.34_02 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Implemented sqlite_trace and sqlite_profile methods for simpler
      tracing/profiling; use DBI_TRACE/DBI_PROFILE for more
      complicated cases (ISHIGAKI)

1.35 2011-11-29
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.9 (ISHIGAKI)
    - One small potential break case if you are using FTS4 and ^

1.34_03 2011-11-01
    - Adding an explicit dynamic_config => 1 (ADAMK)
    - bind_param SQL_INTEGER error now actually dies with RaiseError.
      (ISHIGAKI)

1.34_02 2011-10-21
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Resolved #67581: bind_param SQL_INTEGER numifies value;
      Now DBD::SQLite croaks if you explicitly specify datatype
      (with bind_param) and datatype mismatch happens (ISHIGAKI)
    - Datatype set in the bind_param(_array) becomes sticky now
      (as per DBI spec). This potentially affects code depending on
      current undocumented and broken behavior. (Yuriy Kaminskiy)

    - Resolved #71311: binding output columns as SQL_BLOB returns
      nothing (ISHIGAKI)
    - Bsymbolic flag was not portable enough and was not silently
      ignored under MacOSX. Needs to check harder to see if the
      linker supports the option. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Fixed binding named parameters. (Yuriy Kaminskiy)
    - Moved check for bind_ph/is_inout so it always error-out.
      (Yuriy Kaminskiy)
    - Don't set imp_sth->stmt to NULL on error path (Yuriy Kaminskiy)
    - Explained an issue of rollback with unfinished statements.
      (ISHIGAKI)

1.34_01 2011-09-22
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.8 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Made util/getsqlite.pl work properly for SQLite 3.7.5+ (ISHIGAKI)
    - Cookbook: don't use globals (Yuriy Kaminskiy)
    - Resolved #70135 and hopefully other mod_perl/CentOS issues like
      #63873 and #47983, with a patch by MDOOTSON++ (ISHIGAKI)

1.33 2011-05-20
    - Production release, no changes from 1.32_04

1.32_04 2011-05-20
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.6.3 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Made util/getsqlite.pl state that it needs fixing to work for
      SQLite 3.7.5+ when it dies at the last step, and outline what the
      user needs to do manually instead, until getsqlite is fixed (DUNCAND)

1.32_03 2011-05-12
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.6.2 (ISHIGAKI)

      state (ISHIGAKI)

1.32_02 2011-03-07
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.5 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #65267 for DBD-SQLite: Add RTree support option;
      skip fts3/metadata tests if those features are disabled
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #65267: Add RTree support option (CJFIELDS)
    - Added sqlite_see_if_its_a_number database handle attribute
      to deal with issues caused by (quoted) bind values against
      numbers such as return values from a function etc. (ISHIGAKI)

1.32_01 2010-12-10
    - Made util/getsqlite.pl work with the amalg distro filename changes
      introd by SQLite 3.7.4, and still with older ones also (DUNCAND)
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.4 (DUNCAND)
    - Resolved #61355: Fails testing in parallel (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #61361: Problems building 1.31 with system SQLite (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #61117: Supporting database as an alias for dbname in
      DSN (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #62370: Segfaults during operations on disconnected
      handles (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #61958: REGEXP should return NULL when one of its
      arguments is NULL (ISHIGAKI)
    - Removed PrintWarn tweak introduced in 1.19_09 (Tim Bunce's
      advice) (ISHIGAKI)

    - Moved DBD::SQLite::FTS3Transitional into a dedicated dist (DAMI)
    - Updated bundled Test::NoWarnings to 1.02 (ADAMK)
    - Slightly bumped Test::More and added Test::Builder dependencies,
      because they are inherited from the bundled Test::NoWarnings (ADAMK)
    - Upgraded ppport.h to the latest version (ADAMK)

1.30_05 2010-08-27
    - Test::NoWarnings bundled in the "inc" directory was ignored
      in a new test. (ISHIGAKI)

1.30_04 2010-08-25
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.2 (DUNCAND)
    - Resolved #60698: "Test failures with SQLite 3.7", using included
      patch by Niko Tyni (ntyni@debian.org) of t/lib/Test.pm (DUNCAND)
    - Added support for FTS3 tokenizers written in Perl. Added tests
      and documentation on how to use FTS3. Changed compilation flag
      to use the recommanded -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS
      *** MAY POSSIBLY BREAK OLD APPLICATIONS THAT ALREADY USED FTS3 ***
      (DAMI)
    - Fixed various backward compatibility issues back to SQLite 3.6.1
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #58332: Documentation error for preventing fsync
      (ISHIGAKI)

1.30_03 2010-05-21

    - Added compile_options() to get compile options (ISHIGAKI)
    - Fixed punctuation; suggested by Father Chrysostomos (ISHIGAKI)
    - Ignore unknown collations, as they may be installed without

    - Implemented sqlite_use_immediate_transaction database handle
      attribute to avoid deadlocks easily (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #55466: Problem with names in DB that using square
      bracers (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added SQLITE_ENABLE_LOCKING_STYLE=0 for Mac OSX to avoid
      compile error (ISHIGAKI)

1.30_01 2010-03-10
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Resolved #54271: Inserting a string with utf-8 flag on
      corrupts BLOB data; now BLOB data is always stored as bytes
      (without the utf-8 flag) even if it has the flag set (ISHIGAKI)
    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.23 (DUNCAND)
    - Implemented NUM_OF_PARAMS statement handle attribute (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added experimental "sqlite_allow_multiple_statements"
      database handle attribute, and "sqlite_unprepared_statements"
      statement handle attribute, to allow processing a SQL dump.
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #53579: Added a note and a test of placeholders.
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #45113, which was actually an issue of dequoting
      primary key column names (ISHIGAKI)
    - You can now retrieve some of the statement handle attributes
      before you execute. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added preamble to copy sqlite3.[hc] files into a share
      directory (where you can access via File::ShareDir) to allow
      extension authors to use the same C source/header as they
      used to build DBD::SQLite itself. (ISHIGAKI)

1.29 2010-01-08
    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.22 (DUNCAND)

1.28_02 2010-01-03
    - Now empty (or comment only) statements won't cause segv
      or "not an error" errors. Spotted by TOKUHIROM. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #52573: previous fix always turned on the AutoCommit
      flag; it goes along with the behavior of the internal library
      but broke compat. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Removed the SQLITE_CORE and SQLITE_PRT_SZ flags at the recommendation
      of the SQLite mailing list. (ADAMK)

1.28_01 2009-12-22
    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.21 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Silence warnings on HP-UX (HMBRAND)
    - Resolved #52573: Manual Transaction handling seems to be
      broken (hopefully) (ISHIGAKI)

1.27 2009-11-23
    - Switching to a production version

1.26_07 2009-11-15
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Foreign keys support is once again disabled by default.
      It seems to have a greater impact than we expected and
      it actually broke things. This feature probably will be
      enabled by default by the sqlite team in the future, and
      eventually you'll need to cope with it, but right now we
      agreed with some discussion to give you more time to be
      prepared. If you use referential stuff in your schema
      (which sqlite ignores now) should do extensive testing
      to ensure that they will work when you issue "PRAGMA
      foreign_keys = ON". (ISHIGAKI)

    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.20 (DUNCAND)
    - Resolved #50935: there remained old "unicode" attribute usage
      in the pod, spotted by ASHLEY. (ISHIGAKI)

1.26_06 2009-10-28
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Removed undocumented (and most probably unused) reset method
      from a statement handle (which was only accessible via func().)
      Simply use "$sth->finish" instead. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Now DBD::SQLite supports foreign key constraints by default.
      Long-ignored foreign keys (typically written for other DB
      engines) will start working. If you don't want this feature,
      issue a pragma to disable foreign keys. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Renamed "unicode" attribute to "sqlite_unicode" for integrity.
      Old "unicode" attribute is still accessible but will be
      deprecated in the near future. (ISHIGAKI)

    - You can see file/line info while tracing even if you compile
      with a non-gcc compiler. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Major code refactoring. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Pod reorganized, and some of the missing bits (including
      pragma) are added. (ISHIGAKI)

1.26_05 2009-10-15
    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.19 (ISHIGAKI)

1.26_04 2009-10-06
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Resolved #49716: Fixed $dbh->column_info to work according to
      the spec in DBI and added support for attached databases. (VLYON)
    - Fixed $sth->primary_key_info to work according to the spec in DBI
      and changed the tests in t/27_metadata.t to reflect this. (VLYON)
    - Tweaked not to hide a real error by a "not an error" issued
      by another sqlite3 function between the failed sqlite3 function
      and the sqlite_error to report. Note that this change makes
      some failures issue two relevant errors at a time. (ISHIGAKI)

    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.18 (DUNCAND)
    - Resolved #48393: previous effort was not enough; BegunWork
      should also be handled properly (ISHIGAKI)
    - Replaced last DBILOGFP with DBIc_LOGPIO(imp_xxh) (ISHIGAKI)
    - Tweaked t/08_busy.t not to fail just because it is tested
      under a very, very slow (virtual) machine. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added a code to look for a compiler from Module::Install::Can.
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added documentation and an 'Escape' attribute for $sth->table_info.
      (VLYON)

1.26_03 2009-08-12
    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.17 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Switched to use :memory: for most of the tests (ISHIGAKI)
    - Fixed a memory leak when prepare should fail (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added support for commit/rollback/update hooks (DAMI)
    - Added support for set_authorizer (DAMI)
    - Added support for collation_needed(), and reorganised driver API
      for user-defined collations (DAMI)
    - Exported constants from sqlite3.h into DBD::SQLite namespace (DAMI)
    - Added support in t/lib/Test.pm for checking both versions of
      driver-private methods ("func" / "sqlite_*") (DAMI)
    - Removed unused and obsolete "list_tables" from SQLite.xs (DAMI)
    - Added a default implementation for the REGEXP infix operator (DAMI)
    - Renamed several internal sqlite3_ functions to sqlite_
      for clarity (ISHIGAKI)
    - Accept empty filename at connect (sqlite will open a tempfile) (DAMI)
    - Documented the connect() method (DAMI)
    - Replaced imp_dbh->in_tran with sqlite3_get_autocommit(), hoping
      this would fix the annoying rollback issues, including #48393
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - META.yml requires is now generated instead of being derived from the
      (incorrect) PREREQ_PM values by ExtUtils::MakeMaker (ADAMK)

1.26_02 2009-06-19
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Resolved #46831: table_info schema is incorrect and doesn't
      work with attached databases (VLYON/ISHIGAKI)

    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.15 (DUNCAND)
    - Resolved #44882: Use of $h->func() should be deprecated and
      replaced with calls to driver-private 'installed methods'
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added access to Online Backup functionality. (TJC)
    - Added enable_load_extension pod (ISHIGAKI)
    - Now private methods/functions return true after successful
      calls (#44871) (ISHIGAKI)
    - Removed all of the "croak"s (#44871) (ISHIGAKI)

1.26_01 2009-05-05
    - Added ORDINAL_POSITION support for $dbh->column_info (ADAMK)
    - Applied several fixes from GFUJI to clean up code (#45578)
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - Skipped some of the unicode path tests under cygwin (#45166)
      (JDHEDDEN)
    - Added some explanation and workarounds for a SQL that
      compares a return value of a function with a numeric bind
      value (ISHIGAKI)

1.25 2009-04-23
    - Amalgamation conversion turned out to be quicker than expected.
    - Changing to a production release.  (ADAMK)

1.24_02 2009-04-22
    - Merging various externally-contributed annotations from
      annocpan.org (ADAMK)
    - Created the beginnings of a DBD::SQLite::Cookbook (ADAMK)

1.24_01 2009-04-22
    - Moved getsqlite.pl into util (ADAMK)
    - Switching to the RT queue instead of the RT report page that
      does nothing and just refers you to email (ADAMK)
    - Now DBD::SQLite also uses amalgamated source recommended at sqlite.org (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #45166: better unicode path handling under cygwin (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #45171: test failure on CentOS 4.6 (ISHIGAKI)

1.23 2009-04-19
    - No changes from 1.22_08, just switched to production release (ADAMK)

    - Prevented a double "commit is innefective" warning (ADAMK)
    - Adding a version for the Win32.pm dependency (ADAMK)

1.22_07 2009-04-16
    - Improved non-latin unicode filename support/test
      on Windows (SZABGAB/ISHIGAKI)
    - Removed the table name generator from t/lib.pl,
      getting us closer to removing t/lib.pl entirely (ADAMK)
    - Increased use of Test::NoWarnings (ADAMK)
    - Converted half the remaining lib.pl tests to t::lib::Test (ADAMK)
    - Require Win32.pm on Windows (CHORNY)

    - Dropping support for uncode before 5.8.5 to simplify support and
      to prevent people hurting themselves on platforms that don't
      properly support Unicode anyway (ADAMK)
    - Stopped guessing if a bind param looks like a number or not
      (suggested by GUIDO). This reopens #29058 and #29629, but
      there are two workarounds for them. 1) Use "bind_param"
      explicitly (rather than plain "execute", as you do for BLOB).
      2) Add "+0" to the appropriate part(s) of your SQL to let
      sqlite convert them into a number. (ISHIGAKI)

    - Added comments on the return values on error, and fixed another
      wrong return value in execute (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added SQL_NULLABLE_UNKNOWN; still wonders if the error above
      should be ignored or not (ISHIGAKI)

1.22_01 2009-04-09
    - Resolved #25371: Calls sv_utf8_upgrade on strings going into
       the database to make sure latin-1 strings are not saved as
       Malformed UTF-8 character in the SQLite TEXT column (MIYAGAWA)

1.21 2009-04-09

      the ticket based on _08, which was a flaw in the Makefile.PL
      involving an always-applied -Dno_last_insert_id, but it turns out
      CHORNY had inadvertantly applied the fix in the name of DBI cleaning)
    - Starting to use Test::NoWarnings in the test scripts (ADAMK)

      looks like a number (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #27553: prepare_cached and analyze issue (actually
      this has been fixed before) (ISHIGAKI)

    - Don't convert things that look like numbers to numbers unless
      specifically requested.
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.2.2

1.08
    - Support 64 bit integers (uses floating point numbers when perl is not 
        compiled with 64 bit int support). This also fixes issues with using
        sqlite timestamps.
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.1.3
    - Fix issues of not finding rows when providing a number that perl sees as
        a string.

1.04
    - Patched to make it compile on Windows (Steve Hay)
    - Fetch next row at end of DBI's fetch() so that one-row
      selects don't need to call ->finish(). This restores DBD::SQLite
      0.31's behaviour (and should make popfile work again)

      internally.

0.26
    - Update to sqlite 2.8.5
    - Automatic binary encoding added (via a flag)
    - Better getsqlite.pl - now deals with new files
    - Extension functions and aggregates can be created in
      perl space now.

0.25
    - Fixed Makefile.PL to no longer try creating a .c file to determine
      the OS ptrsize - use Config.pm directly in the DEFINE

      SQL, which should improve locking problems.

0.10
    - Fixed missing SQLiteXS.h from 0.09
